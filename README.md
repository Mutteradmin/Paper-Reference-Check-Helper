# Paper_Reference_Check_Helper
This is an effective assistant for checking the references in your papers, which can provide great help when you are writing your papers, especially the literature review. 

# Note when using
You can make the program an .exe file or either directly use it by running main_GUI.py in Python. For a flasher use of .exe file, remember to use pyinstaller(my python version is 3.9) to process the main body of the code and find your .exe in \dist folder. An exmaple of CLI operation is "pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon="app_icon.ico" --add-data "ref_checker_logic.py;." --add-data "icon.png;." --collect-all "pybtex" main_gui.py".
