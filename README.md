# Paper_Reference_Check_Helper
This is an effective and light-flash assistant for checking the references and rapidly finding out problems in your papers with just uploading .bib and .tex file of the paper, which can provide great help when you are writing papers agonizingly, especially the literature review. 

# Note when using
You can pack the program to an .exe file or either directly use it by running main_GUI.py in Python. For a flasher use of .exe file, remember to use Pyinstaller(my python version is 3.9) to process the main body of the code and find your .exe in \dist folder after it completes. An exmaple of CLI operation is "pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon="app_icon.ico" --add-data "ref_checker_logic.py;." --add-data "icon.png;." --collect-all "pybtex" main_gui.py".
